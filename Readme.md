# About
<p> Generate a program that calculates the average of N values received via the keyboard, and at the end shows the sum of the values, the amount of entered values and the calculated average value </p>

# Requirements
<p> I recommend running in some IDE such as Jupyter Notebook, VS Code </p>

# Problem
<p> User needs to calculate sum, average and count values of sales made daily, however, the way to do it is manual. This process is time-wasting and has risks of errors during arithmetic operations. </p>

# Solution
<p> Create a program to interact with the user, register information, perform arithmetic operations and handle possible filling errors </p>
